# Cube Scrambler 1.0 by Kevin Belleville

Provides scrambles for the 3x3 Rubik's Cube in the standard form. Scrambles consist of 25 moves and are unique. 

## Notation

If you don't know how to read speedcuber lingo, here's a quick rundown. A Rubik's Cube has six sides and are notated in the following way:

  * R - right 
  * L - left
  * U - up
  * D - down
  * F - front
  * B - back

Each of these sides can be turned in three possible ways: clockwise, counter-clockwise, or 180 degrees. Clockwise is simply the side without a denotation, counter-clockwise is denoted with a prime symbol ('), and a 180 degree turn is denoted with a '2'.
